# SaveDebloater
A safe Windows 10 and Windows 8/8.1 debloater, that doesn't need admin rights.
# How to use
Right click on the SafeDebloat.ps1 and run with PowerShell
# Notes
-This is a safe debloater which does not remove all packages. It does not remove packages like Defender or the Windows 8.1 Photos app.
However most of them get removed

-On Windows 8.1 if you want to remove the rest of the packages, go to C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs and delete
the shortcuts there.
